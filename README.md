## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a backend developer experienced in building scalable and high-performance APIs using FastAPI and PostgreSQL. This repository is a collection of my workâ€”ranging from small experiments to fully structured projectsâ€”focused on creating clean, efficient backend systems.

FastAPI is my go-to framework for developing modern web APIs. I appreciate its speed, intuitive syntax, and built-in support for data validation and documentation through Pydantic and OpenAPI. My goal is to write code that is not only fast and robust but also easy to maintain and extend. I enjoy designing RESTful endpoints, implementing authentication flows, and structuring projects in a modular and testable way.

On the data side, I rely on PostgreSQL for its reliability, advanced querying capabilities, and flexibility. Iâ€™ve worked with relational schema design, query optimization, indexing strategies, and data migrationsâ€”ensuring that the data layer is just as scalable and resilient as the application logic. I also enjoy using ORMs like SQLAlchemy to bridge between Python and SQL while maintaining clarity and performance.

This repository showcases various backend projects that demonstrate practical use casesâ€”such as user authentication, CRUD operations, background task processing, and API versioning. Each project reflects real-world patterns and follows best practices for API design, error handling, and database interaction.

As I continue to build and learn, I aim to create backends that are production-ready and developer-friendly. If youâ€™re interested in FastAPI, PostgreSQL, or backend engineering in general, feel free to explore the code, offer feedback, or collaborate.

Thanks for visitingâ€”and hereâ€™s to building scalable backends, one endpoint at a time.
